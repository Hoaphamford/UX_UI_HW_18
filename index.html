        <h4>UX Design</h4>
        <p>Good UX design means incorporating the ideas of developers, clients, and team members. UX designers need to effectively give and receive feedback, explore solutions, and incorporate the expertise and needs of everyone involved in a project to create the best products possible.</p>

        <h4>UI Design</h4>
        <p>Consistency is key to UI design as it increases products' learnability. Good UI design comes from creating a sense of familiarity and ensuring that everything on a screen makes sense and works in ways that the user expects it to work.</p>

          <p>Wireframing is a technique that visually articulates and communicates ideas about how to solve a particular problem. It focuses on two key points: the steps required to complete a specific business or user goal, and the digital interactive elements that may be necessary to achieve this. The wireframing process can be large or small. It can be used to illustrate an entire end-to-end user journey or to solve smaller, micro-interactions that take place within a single step of a journey. Wireframing is a process that can be used across the entire design domain, but it is particularly useful within the web, service blueprint, and product design.Wireframing is a technique that visually articulates and communicates ideas about how to solve a particular problem.

          <p>Wireframes provide insight into the progress of a product or feature. If wireframes are still at an early stage of development and they include annotations or ideation areas, it suggests that the exploration of an idea is still in progress. This is beneficial as it helps people understand the impact of their feedback. If feedback is provided early, it is likely to be easier to implement and have fewer consequences than a wireframe that is close to being fully complete and tested.Wireframes provide insight into the progress of a product or feature.

          <p>Another time to wireframe is during or after discussions with key stakeholders, such as product owners, CTOs, etc. Individuals within these roles often take on a business perspective of product delivery, and it is the job of the designer to try and produce a product that will deliver both business and UX outcomes. Wireframes are a crucial starting point in helping to visually understand how these goals can be balanced against each other in order to benefit both parties.Another time to wireframe is during or after discussions with key stakeholders, such as product owners, CTOs, etc. Individuals within these roles often take on a business perspective of product delivery, and it is the job of the designer to try and produce a product that will deliver both business and UX outcomes.
